        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div class="subContentBlock">
            Lauda Musicam of Atlanta is a group of early music enthusiasts performing concerts throughout
            the year, as well as enriching the church services at St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church, where
            the group is an ensemble-in-residence. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ensemble is
            meeting virtually, but still going strong with more members than ever before!

        <h1>Fall 2021</h1>
        <article class="subContentBlock" style="margin-top: 20px">
            Fall 2021 marks the beginning of Lauda Musicam’s 13 th season. Rehearsals will be held via
            Zoom videoconferencing platform through December 2021, with a decision about Spring 2022
            rehearsals announced prior to that time. Music Director Jody Miller will take the ensemble
            through repertoire that includes quodlibets, early 20 th century compositions by some
            composers central to the early music revival, polychoral works, and more. Playalong practice
            tracks are provided and you will be given the opportunity to contribute recordings to create a
            Lauda Musicam &quot;performance.&quot;
            There is no strict audition requirement at this time, as the online format allows for better self-
            paced participation. Membership is $100 for the season, but you can choose to play in two
            $50-dollar payments if the decision to go to in-person rehearsals will affect your ability to
            attend. If you would like to participate, click the link below. This is an outstanding value, as it is
            like attending 90-minute workshops for approximately $5 each week. We welcome you to
            invite your ensemble partners to join and use the weekly instruction to help you improve, get
            some repertoire suggestions, and to network with others with similar interests.

                    The time of the English Restoration not only brought political changes and an expansion of trade, but also a surge in literary and artistic works.  While the German-born George Frideric Handel was one of the leading composers of the period, English composers such as Henry Purcell, John Blow, and Thomas Arne were creating iconic English works for ballad operas and the theater, solidifying England’s role in entertaining the masses who hungered to be both listeners and performers.  From the lute songs of Thomas Campion to Arne’s “Rule Britannia,” the English helped popularize music through the formation of choral societies, private in-home performances, and music festivals.
