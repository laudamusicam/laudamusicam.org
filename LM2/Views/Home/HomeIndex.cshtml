        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div class="subContentBlock">
            Lauda Musicam of Atlanta is a group of early music enthusiasts performing concerts throughout
            the year, as well as enriching the church services at St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church, where
            the group is an ensemble-in-residence. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ensemble is
            meeting virtually, but still going strong with more members than ever before!

        <h1>Spring 2022</h1>
        <article class="subContentBlock" style="margin-top: 20px">
            Lauda Musicam of Atlanta continues its 13th season virtually through the Zoom video conference platform.
            We invite our local Atlanta musicians as well as musicians from afar as we learn music of "Feasting & Fasting."
            Both feasting and fasting have been significant aspects of religious observances.
            We'll look at music of Judaism, Christianity, and beyond, in our study of accompanying musical selections.
            Playalong practice tracks are provided and you will be given the opportunity to contribute recordings to create
            a Lauda Musicam "performance."
            There is no strict audition requirement at this time, as the online format allows for better self-paced
            participation.
            Membership dues are $50 for the remainder of the season.
            We welcome you to invite your ensemble partners to join and use the weekly instruction to help improve,
            get some repertoire suggestions, and to network with others with similar interests.

                    The time of the English Restoration not only brought political changes and an expansion of trade, but also a surge in literary and artistic works.  While the German-born George Frideric Handel was one of the leading composers of the period, English composers such as Henry Purcell, John Blow, and Thomas Arne were creating iconic English works for ballad operas and the theater, solidifying England’s role in entertaining the masses who hungered to be both listeners and performers.  From the lute songs of Thomas Campion to Arne’s “Rule Britannia,” the English helped popularize music through the formation of choral societies, private in-home performances, and music festivals.
