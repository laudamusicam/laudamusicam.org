        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div class="subContentBlock">
            Lauda Musicam of Atlanta is a group of early music enthusiasts performing concerts throughout the year,
            as well as enriching the church services at St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church,
            where the group is an ensemble-in-residence.
            In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ensemble met virtually from September 2020 through May 2022,
            but still continued to grow with more members than ever before!
            Moving forward, online rehearsal options will continue,
            while in-person rehearsals resume in anticipation of presenting crowd-pleasing concerts to our fans.

            Renaissance, and Baroque periods.
            In-person participants will meet weekly on Monday evenings, 7:00-8:30
            at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in Atlanta;
            online participants will meet weekly on Tuesday evenings, 7:00-8:30 Eastern Time,
            via Zoom video conferencing platform.
            Online participants will be given the opportunity to come join the in-person group for an extended rehearsal
            the weekend of each concert and perform that concert with us.

                    The time of the English Restoration not only brought political changes and an expansion of trade, but also a surge in literary and artistic works.  While the German-born George Frideric Handel was one of the leading composers of the period, English composers such as Henry Purcell, John Blow, and Thomas Arne were creating iconic English works for ballad operas and the theater, solidifying England’s role in entertaining the masses who hungered to be both listeners and performers.  From the lute songs of Thomas Campion to Arne’s “Rule Britannia,” the English helped popularize music through the formation of choral societies, private in-home performances, and music festivals.
